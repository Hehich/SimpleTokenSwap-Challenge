# ðŸš€ Master the Simple Token Swap Challenge

Congratulations for completing ERC20 Basic Challenge!

You have now grasped the functionality of ERC20 tokens. Ever wondered how you can use these tokens to swap to another token (i.e WETH to USDC)?

Let's learn how the `exactInputSingle()` function in Uniswap works! ðŸ’ª

## Objective

Your task is to:

1. Develop your own contract with Swap functionality.
2. Deploy it to Scroll Sepolia Testnet.
3. And finally verify it.

If you need help with using a smart contract framework for completing this challenge, the [Level Up: Build with Foundry](https://www.levelup.xyz/content/level-up-foundry) guide might be a helpful start!

If you get stuck, feel free to ask for help in [Level Up Telegram group](https://t.me/+PdNbk5milo1mMTAy).

        // Approve the Uniswap router to spend the input tokens

        // Call the Uniswap router's exactInputSingle function to execute the swap
